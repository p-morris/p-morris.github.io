        <h2>Filter and apply for shifts</h2>
        <p>Nurses filter the latest shifts and apply for the ones that fit their lifestyle. Once their application is accepted, they receive a notification and the shift is added to their default calendar. The app is integrated with Google Maps, CityMapper, Apple Maps and Waze for directions on the day of the shift.</p>
